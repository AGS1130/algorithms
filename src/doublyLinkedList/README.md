# Implement a doubly linked list in TypeScript
> In a doubly linked list each node in the list stores the contents of the node and a pointer or reference to the next and the previous nodes in the list. It is one of the simplest way to store a collection of items.
> In this lesson we cover how to create a doubly linked list data structure and how to use its strenghts to implement an O(1) FIFO queue + O(1) LIFO stack.
